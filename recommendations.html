        <h3>Aldo Ruiz Parra </h3>
        <p>I was lucky enough to work with Maniko for 3 months in the CodePath Software Engineering course. Maniko is a motivated, forward-thinking, and intelligent student with lots of ambition. Heâ€™s got a natural ability to think outside the box and able to solve complex problems. His exceptional problem-solving skills make him understand complicated matters faster and is an expert in optimizing every solution. He is extremely enthusiastic about his work which was inspiring to me, he has a positive attitude towards work and is an asset to any team he is on.</p>
