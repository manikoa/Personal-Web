    At Code Savanna, we are passionate about cultivating the potential of young people in Zambia and harnessing their talent for the greater good. We believe that technology and entrepreneurship are powerful catalysts for socioeconomic development, and through our nonprofit organization, we are dedicated to supporting and connecting the next generation of leaders in these fields.

Our primary focus is on mentorship, as we recognize the invaluable role it plays in guiding and nurturing young minds. Through our mentorship program, we aim to inspire, educate, and empower young individuals to identify local problems and develop innovative, entrepreneurial, and technological solutions.

By fostering a supportive network of experienced mentors and providing access to resources, training, and opportunities, we strive to create a conducive environment for young leaders to learn, grow, and thrive. We believe that by equipping young people with the skills, knowledge, and mindset needed to be self-sufficient and sustainable, they can drive positive change and contribute to the socioeconomic development of our beloved country, Zambia.

Join us in our mission to unlock the potential of Zambia's youth, paving the way for a brighter future where innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology intersect to shape a prosperous and inclusive society."
