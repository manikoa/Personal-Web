                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <h5>Aspiring Software Engineer <span>& PM </span></h5>
                <p>Hey and welcome to my website! My name is Anthony Maniko, and I’m a sophomore, <a href="https://cs.whitman.edu">Computer Science</a> student at <a href="https://www.whitman.edu/">Whitman College</a> aspiring to be a software engineer and PM, and passionate about creating impactful solutions through code. <br>

                    I’m a founder at Code Savanna. A non-profit organization that aims to encourage, connect, and support the next generation of young leaders in technology and entrepreneurship in Zambia. Our mission is to empower and equip these young people and provide them with the necessary tools, resources, and mentorship to identify local challenges and develop innovative, sustainable solutions that contribute to the socioeconomic development of our country. <br>
                    
                    I recently founded TalkLY - a school podcast that aims to promote understanding, celebrate diversity, and empower voices that are too often silenced. By amplifying the stories and perspectives of people of color, TalkLY seeks to inspire, educate, and foster a sense of community within the school and beyond.<br>
                    
                    In my spare time, I enjoy skiing, taking walks to pioneer park :), playing board games, and reading about new technological advancements. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and feel free to reach out if you’d like to connect!
